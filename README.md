# CRDA-Mod
This script allows you to modify the maximum output power limitations set by the CRDA for wireless 802.11 devices.

These limitations are set by national and international agencies. Changing These limitations outside of the maximum values already defined is illegal in most countries.

In addition to legality, higher power levels are harmful to health and can cause hardware failure.

Use this tool/script at your own risk.
